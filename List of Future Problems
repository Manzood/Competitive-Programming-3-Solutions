1) Initial bitmask example (page 29 is the solution)
2) A bunch of the very easy, easy and medium problems from the Chapter 1 (I skipped them because I did not see any value in undergoing the tedium of coding each of them out for themselves, but sometimes tedium is valuable entirely for the sake of tedium itself)
3) The ad hoc problems. Again, they seem tedius and don't help me logically. Maybe they would improve my skill as a programmer, but other than that they don't seem to help me all that much intellectually. I did a couple that seemed to help, but due to eagerness to move onto chapter 2, I skipped most of them. Maybe in a future pass?
